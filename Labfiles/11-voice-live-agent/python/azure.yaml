# Student template: GPT Realtime model resources for AI Foundry
# This template ONLY provisions AI resources - it does NOT deploy the application
# Students will use the OpenAI endpoint directly in their local development

# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-dev/main/schemas/v1.0/azure.yaml.json

name: gpt-realtime-model
metadata:
  template: azd-init@1.19.0

# Note: When running 'azd down', you will be prompted to purge the AI Foundry resource
# To skip the prompt and auto-purge, use: azd down --purge

# NO SERVICES - This template only provisions infrastructure
# Students will run the Flask app locally and connect to the deployed OpenAI service

# After provisioning, you'll get:
# - Azure AI Foundry Project for experimentation
# - OpenAI service with GPT realtime model deployed
# - Endpoint and API key for your local Flask app
#

# DO NOT run 'azd deploy' - the application is deployed outside of this process.
# This template only creates the AI resources students need
