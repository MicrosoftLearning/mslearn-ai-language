Good Hotel and staff
The Royal Hotel, London, UK
3/2/2018
Clean rooms, good service, great location near Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, and so on.
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
The courtyard is very peaceful and we went to a restaurant which is part of the same group and is Indian ( West coast so plenty of fish) with a Michelin Star.
We had the taster menu which was fabulous.
The rooms were very well appointed with a kitchen, lounge, bedroom and enormous bathroom.
Thoroughly recommended.
